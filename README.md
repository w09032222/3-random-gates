# 3-random-gates

This is a 3-channel random gates module feature with 3 gate outputs and 2 logic outputs.Every random channel has a random level control and can be CV-controlled.A external clock signal is required to trigger a random gate for opening/closing a gate signal.

Logic outputs can manually switch between AND mode and XAND mode.The two logic outputs are out-for-2 and out-for-3 channel.

Out-for-2 channel will output a gate signal whenever there are two random gate channels are "true" depends on its setting mode(AND or XAND).

Out-for-3 channel is same as the former one but the only different is the out-for-3 channel will only be "true" if the three random gates are "true" with each other.
